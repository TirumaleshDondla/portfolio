            <div>
                <p>Seven billion people are on this Earth,
                     and everybody is different from the rest of others. 
                     There is nothing without purpose in this world. 
                     Everything has some purpose. 
                     Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. Thus, writing about myself, I’m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life. I try myself to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking and honest.

                <p><b>My Family and My Childhood</b><br>
                    <br>
                    I’m from a middle-class family of AP, I am tirumalesh. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a respectable businessman in our community.
                    
                    My mother is a housewife. They both love their occupation. That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose.
                    
                 I am wanted to guide and take care of my other siblings. We all are in the same school. Reading is my passion.
                    
                    I am a keen reader of novels and history books as I have a strong interest in Indian History and classical architecture. I love to read books that refer to the rich history and civilization of ancient India.  At my pre-childhood, I used to listen to stories from my grandmother, and this has a long-lasting effect on me </p>

                <p>Without good career planning, right from the start, one can’t be on the right track. One has to set the goals in accordance with his or her broad career goals.

                    I have studied biology and I will seat for the competitive entrance exam for admission to reputed medical college. I shall try to be a good and honest student. Then I shall be a qualified doctor. I will do all that to be a good doctor and will be sincere to it.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie. My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my best to do so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out there; it’s in you.”</p>

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to serve my people in whatever capacity I can.
